### Repository Set Up
Within this repository I have a folder named **final_proj** that holds...
- **app.r:** A script that holds the code to my shiny app
- **data_dict:** A data dictionary that corresponds to my raw data
- **gbr.png:** An image of the Great Barrier Reef that I use in my shiny app and also included below!
- **manta-tow-by-reef.csv:** My raw data from AIMS
- **rsconnect:** A folder that was created once I published my shiny app

### Project Background
Using data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), I was interested to visualize how coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef has changed over time. This data inculdes 11 study sites that span across the coast of Queensland and includes several reefs within each site. Please note that this project simply attempts to visualize change in mean percent cover of coral and does not attempt to determine causes for change. 

#### Project Objectives
1. Create a map to see the study's survey sites across the Great Barrier Reef
2. Visualize percent live coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef between 1992 - 2022
3. See how percent live and dead coral cover changed within each reef over time

**NOTE:** All data analysed was collected from the Australian Institute of Marine Science's Long-Term Monitoring Project. <br>
